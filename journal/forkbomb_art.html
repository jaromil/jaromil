<h1>ASCII Shell Forkbomb</h1>    
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p class="image"><img src="images/forkbomb.png" alt=""></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">The code  <strong>:(){ :|:&amp;  };:</strong> provides arguably  one of the  most elegant
examples of  a fork bomb.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">It was presented as a free and open source piece of net:art in 2002,
along with a text titled <a href="forkbomb.html">la bohème digitale</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From the Wikipedia article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_bomb">Fork_bomb</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">In  computing, the  fork bomb,  a form  of  denial-of-service attack
against  a  computer  system,  implements  the  fork  operation  (or
equivalent  functionality)  whereby  a  running process  can  create
another running process. Fork bombs count as wabbits: they typically
do not  spread as  worms or viruses.  To incapacitate a  system they
rely on  the assumption  that the number  of programs  and processes
which may execute simultaneously on a computer has a limit.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">A  fork bomb  works by  creating a  large number  of  processes very
quickly  in order to  saturate the  available space  in the  list of
processes kept  by the computer's  operating system. If  the process
table  becomes saturated, no  new programs  may start  until another
process terminates.  Even if that happens,  it is not  likely that a
useful  program may  be  started  since the  instances  of the  bomb
program  will   each  attempt  to  take   any  newly-available  slot
themselves.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">Not only  do fork bombs use  space in the process  table: each child
process uses further processor-time and memory. As a result of this,
the  system and  existing programs  slow down  and become  much more
unresponsive and difficult or even impossible to use.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">As well  as being  specifically malicious, fork  bombs can  occur by
accident in  the normal development of software.  The development of
an  application that listens  on a  network socket  and acts  as the
server in a  Client-server system may well use  an infinite loop and
fork operation in a manner  similar to one of the programs presented
below. A trivial bug in the source of this kind of application could
cause a fork bomb during testing.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>net:art</h3>

<p class="first">Within  the first  5  years  of circulation,  this  net:art piece  has
propagated on computer screens, t-shirts and most impressively for its
own author: <strong>tattoos</strong>.</p>

<p>Also featured on the <a href="http://www.geekytattoos.com/fork-bomb-tattoo/">geekytattoos</a> website, among the pioneers carrying
a logic bomb everywhere are <a href="http://silveiraneto.net/2009/10/22/the-fork-bomb-tattoo/">Silveira</a>, <a href="http://www.c0le.org/2010/01/first-tattoo_134.html">C0le</a> and V.</p>

<h2>Critics, essays, publications</h2>

<h3>Curatorial statement p0es1s exhibition</h3>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">This forkbomb is a kind  of poetic virus. If its visually attractive
line of only thirteen characters is entered into the command line of
a  Unix system  and the  enter key  is pressed,  within  seconds the
computer will  crash because the devious little  program commands it
to make multiple copies of  itself, setting off a chain reaction and
thus  quickly  exhausting  the  system’s resources.   Jaromil:  &quot;In
considering a source  code as literature, I am  depicting viruses as
poésie maudite, giambi against those  selling the Net as a safe area
for a  bourgeois society. The  relations, forces and  laws governing
the digital  domain differ from  those in the natural.   The digital
domain  produces  a form  of  chaos—sometimes uncomfortable  because
unusual, although  fertile—to surf thru:  in that chaos  viruses are
spontaneous  compositions,  lyrical   in  causing  imperfections  in
machines  made to  serve and  in representing  the rebellion  of our
digital serfs.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>


<h3>Lecture/Essay by Florian Cramer &quot;Entering the Machine and Leaving It Again: Poetics of Software in Contemporary Art&quot;, Milano 2006</h3>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">This  energy  is  also  embbedded  into  the  twelve  characters  of
jaromil's forkbomb:</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>:(){ :|:&amp; };:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">Most computer operating  systems can be crashed or  at least brought
to  a  grinding  halt  when  users,  even  those  without  superuser
privileges, launch an abundant  ever-growing amount of programs that
eat up all memory and CPU time. The easiest way to achieve this is a
&quot;forkbomb&quot;, a  little program which  does nothing but launch  two or
more copies of itself upon  startup.  Since these copies do the same
in  turn, this  sets  off  a chain  reaction  with an  exponentially
growing   number   of  processes.   Forkbombs   have  been   popular
entertainment among  hackers since about the  mid-1990s, but jaromil
manages to  condense them to  a most terse, poetic  syntax, arguably
the most elegant forkbomb ever written.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">In  other words,  if you  have access  to the  terminal prompt  of a
Unix-like  OS, these twelve  characters -  which look  like Internet
smilies  - can  bring  it down.   It  has become  a  secret code  of
recognition  among the initiated,  like the  stuffed trumpet  of the
Tristero  underground  postal  network  in  Thomas  Pynchon's  novel
&quot;Crying of Lot 49&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">This example also reveals a  problematic issue of the term &quot;software
art&quot;:   That   it   is   often  misunderstood   as   high   programm
craftsmanship. In fact, this understanding has its roots in computer
science  itself.   Donald Knuth's  textbooks  &quot;The  Art of  Computer
Programming&quot; or Paul Graham's recent book &quot;Hackers and Painters&quot; are
founded  on a  post-classicist  notion  of art  as  beauty and  high
craftsmanship, for example in the elegance of an algorithm.</p>
</blockquote>


<h3>Josephine Bosma &quot;Media Spaces&quot; essay on Medien Kunst Netz</h3>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">Jaromil’s  Forkbomb is  a form  of  public rebellion  (he makes  no
secret  of his  identity  or  of his  intentions),  which serves  as
reminder of  a free  space in digital  media that has  become almost
invisible  to the general  audience.  It  is in  this sense  also an
invitation,  like many  other  projects, especially  some new  media
performances, to start fooling around oneself.</p>
</blockquote>


<h3>Tato, techie and blogger at everything2.com</h3>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">In the  Digital Craft exhibit  of Frankfurt's Museum  fur Angewandte
Kunst,  you will  find  this  brilliant piece  of  code poetry.  The
characters  are  silkscreened  in  black  onto  a  meter  square  of
translucent plastic, the whole resting on a simple white surface, in
a display case behind glass.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">Attributed to  a writer identified  only by the name  &quot;Jaromil&quot;, the
exhibit text says that when it is run in a unix shell like zsh, this
letterless code replicates  itself like a virus until  the memory of
the system is full and causes a segmentation fault.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">Pseudocode translation of :(){:|:&amp;};:</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="verse">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:() = Define a function named : (A colon is a legal function name, it would seem.)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{:|:&amp;}; = When this function is called, run a copy of itself<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;: = Execute the function named :, now.<br>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">I'm neither a  h4x0r nor a virologist, but I  wouldn't consider it a
true virus since it can only  replicate when run in a shell executed
by  its  user.  Plus  its  effects  are  negligible.  But  for  it's
typographic  mystique, elegance,  and  efficiency, it  is more  than
code. Like  a little  joke between  the coder and  the OS  about how
simple and mysterious self destruction can be.</p>
</blockquote>



<h3>Internet Society Nederland (ISOC) to guests of the 2009 year reception</h3>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">WHAT  DOES THAT  T-SHIRT  I GOT  MEAN?   Hopefully you  picked up  a
T-shirt in the  patio where we had about 400  of these cool T-shirts
to  give away  in all  sizes. The  back of  the shirt  contained the
oldest drawing known of the ARPANET,  drawn 40 years ago on a napkin
this  september. It  shows the  first two  nodes of  this historical
precursor to  the internet. The  graphic on the front  side contains
two elements: the first  is the 'universally applicable fingerprint'
of German  minister of the interior Wolfgang  Schauble, as published
by the German hackers from Chaos  Computer Club last year as part of
the  societal  debate  on   including  biometric  data  in  identity
documents. The  second is the  famous 'fork bomb' poem  by Amsterdam
based  writer, programmer  and activist  Jaromil.  In  just thirteen
attractive characters  of shell code you will  find enough recursive
power to bring any UNIX-based system to a halt - and it looks pretty
too. You work out what that means, if anything.</p>
</blockquote>
